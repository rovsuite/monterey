Welcome to Monterey version 2.0.0 (beta)!  

Monterey is a FOSS ROV controller that is one of the modules of ROV-suite (http://sourceforge.net/p/rov-suite).  It is written to be simple to use and easy to modify.  After all, not everyone's ROV will have only 3 relays, 2 servos and 5 sensors.  Two main motor layouts are supported by default to give you, the user, support for both vector drive and tank drive configurations.  For controlling the ROV, a wide variety of joysticks are supported through the SDL library (www.libsdl.org).    My goal is to give you the best possible ROV controller for your ROV. 

If you have any issues, questions, comments, ideas, etc, please contact me!

Thanks for trying it out!
